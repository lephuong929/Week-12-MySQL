# Week-12-MySQL

This is an Amazon-like storefront linked to a MySQL database. The app will take in orders from the customer and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

When starting the application, the customer will be presented with all of the items available for purchase. Then, then customer can select which Item ID they would like to purchase and the quantity. If the quantity the customer wishes to purchase is more than the amount in stock, a message will be displayed alerting the customer the order can't be completed. If the quantity is available, the customer will be alerted the purchase price. 

Recording of the app running is provided in the repository.
